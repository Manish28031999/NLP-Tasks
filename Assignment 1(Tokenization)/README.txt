For Q1 And Q2 please check the Q1,2.ipynb and run the blocks sequntially
you have to specify the file path in the code at specified location.I have run the the code on entire given corpus.


Q3 all the word groups are comma seperated.

For Q4 Please check Q4.ipynb and run the blocks sequntially.
In Each Model you need to specify the file ath in in the code at specified location.As per question tokenize the entire corpus so I have done the same.

For Q5 please check  Q5.ipynb.I have taken a file called Sample.txt which contain all the sentences of Q3 and all the word groups I have given as List of List of string.
To check on different input you need to change the Truth List in the code and File path
I have also print the statement and their tokenize version  outputs.
For Q5 you need to run first Q4 because I have used trained model of Unigram and BPE inside that.


For Q6 please check Q6.pdf file
